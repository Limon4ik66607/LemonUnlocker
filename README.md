## 📦 Installation

1.  **Download**: Get the latest `LemonUnlocker.exe` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Limon4ik66607/LemonUnlocker/releases).
2.  **Move**: Place the `.exe` file in a convenient location (e.g., a dedicated folder on your Desktop).
3.  **Run**: Double-click `LemonUnlocker.exe`.
    *   *Note*: Run as **Administrator** if you encounter permission issues during unlocker installation.

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup (The Unlocker)
*   Go to the **Unlocker** tab (Lock icon).
*   Click **Install EA Unlocker**. This patches your game to recognize all DLCs.
*   *You only need to do this once!*

### 2. Downloading DLCs
*   Go to the **Library** or **Catalog** tab.
*   Select the DLCs you want to play.
*   Click **Download**. Wait for the process to finish.
*   The app will automatically extract and install them to your game folder.

### 3. Updating Configuration
*   After downloading new DLCs, go back to the **Unlocker** tab.
*   Click **Update Configs**. This ensures the unlocker knows about the new content.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

*   **Anti-Virus**: Some AVs might flag the unlocker (due to DLL injection techniques). Add the `.exe` or folder to exclusions.
*   **Permission Error**: Run the application as Administrator.
*   **Download Failed**: Check your internet connection and try again. The app supports resuming.
