## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup (The Unlocker)
*   Go to the **Unlocker** tab (Lock icon).
*   Click **Install EA Unlocker**.
    *   **Windows**: This patches your authentic game files.
    *   **macOS**: This creates a special launcher app. You should run the created app to play with DLCs.
*   *You only need to do this once!*

### 2. Downloading DLCs
*   Go to the **Library** (Installed) or **Catalog** (All DLCs) tab.
*   Select the DLCs you want to add to your game.
*   Click **Download**. The app will handle downloading and extracting automatically.

### 3. Updating Configuration
*   After downloading new DLCs, go back to the **Unlocker** tab.
*   Click **Update Configs**. This ensures the unlocker recognizes the newly added content.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Windows
*   **Anti-Virus Flags**: Some AVs might flag the unlocker due to DLL injection. Add the folder/exe to exclusions.
*   **Permission Error**: Make sure to run the application as **Administrator**.
*   **Download Failed**: Check your internet connection. The app supports resuming, so just try again.

### macOS
*   **"App is damaged and can't be opened"**:
    *   Open **Terminal** and run: `xattr -cr /Applications/LemonUnlocker.app`
*   **Game doesn't see DLCs**:
    *   Make sure you are launching the game via the **Assume/Created Launcher** (created by the Unlocker), not directly from Origin/EA App.
